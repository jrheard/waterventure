<intro>
You're sitting on the couch in your living room, absentmindedly petting your cat Frank,
when a local news report on the TV catches your attention:

"...that's right, Bob, this year's winter is going to be just truly, unbelievably dark.
It's barely October, and Portland residents are already preparing for the worst;
marshmallows and blankets are flying off store shelves, and there isn't a single
SAD lamp left for sale in the entire city."

Oh no, it's almost winter! Your mom gave you a SAD lamp last year when you were feeling
super depressed, and it sounds like you're really going to need it this year.
Now where did you put it?

Suddenly nothing in the world is more important to you than finding your special lamp.
You jump off the couch and begin your search. Frank follows you, meowing happily.

[when you feed frank]Frank gobbles down the treat.
He's suddenly filled with energy. He bolts out of the room and runs a lap around the house.

Frank returns and sits by your feet. He purrs happily.

You've found your SAD lamp! You can't remember why you put it here in the first place, but that doesn't matter now.
Exhausted, you turn the lamp on and flop down next to it.
Frank meows happily and curls up next to you, basking in the lamp's glorious blue glow.
