"...that's right, Bob, this year's winter is going to be just truly, unbelievably dark.
It's barely October, and Portland residents are already preparing for the worst;
marshmallows and blankets are flying off store shelves, and there isn't a single
SAD lamp left for sale in the entire city."




You've found your SAD lamp!
Exhausted, you flop down next to it and turn it on.
<cat name> meows happily and curls up next to you, basking in the lamp's glorious blue glow.

Congratulions, you've beaten the game! Press Enter to quit.
