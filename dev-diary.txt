<intro>
You're sitting on the couch in your living room, absentmindedly petting your cat Frank,
when a local news report on the TV catches your attention:

"...that's right, Bob, this year's winter is going to be just truly, unbelievably dark.
It's barely October, and Portland residents are already preparing for the worst;
marshmallows and blankets are flying off store shelves, and there isn't a single
SAD lamp left for sale in the entire city."

Oh no, it's almost winter! Your mom gave you a SAD lamp last year when you were feeling
super depressed in February, and it sounds like you're really going to need it this year.
Now where did you put it?

Suddenly nothing in the world is more important to you than finding your special lamp.
You jump off the couch and begin your search. Frank follows you, meowing.

There are other commands, too, but you've got to figure them out on your own!






You've found your SAD lamp!
Exhausted, you flop down next to it and turn it on.
<cat name> meows happily and curls up next to you, basking in the lamp's glorious blue glow.

Congratulions, you've beaten the game! Press Enter to quit.
